Simply put your character that you are copying from and to and just hit copy. You can even copy a character UI config from another server (as supported).
You can even pre-create the config if you would like and the copy will create the config for your future character.

# Current Supported Servers

**Phoenix** (Currently dead but can copy your old configs over)

**Atlas** 

Feel free to suggest other servers.
